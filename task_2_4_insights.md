# Task 2.4: Key Insights from EDA

## 1. Highly Correlated Features

Features most strongly correlated with SalePrice (from correlation matrix):
- **OverallQual** (~0.79): Overall material and finish quality
- **GrLivArea** (~0.71): Above ground living area square feet  
- **GarageCars** (~0.64): Size of garage in car capacity
- **GarageArea** (~0.62): Size of garage in square feet
- **TotalBsmtSF** (~0.61): Total square feet of basement area

These features are the strongest predictors and should be key in our model.

## 2. Potential Outliers

From histograms and summary statistics:
- **Very large homes**: A few houses with GrLivArea > 4000 sq ft
- **Extreme lot sizes**: Some properties with LotArea > 100,000 sq ft
- **Unusually low prices**: Homes with high GrLivArea but low SalePrice (possible data errors or special circumstances)
- **Old properties**: Houses built before 1900 may behave differently

## 3. Visible Patterns and Trends

From visualizations:
- **Positive relationships**: SalePrice increases with OverallQual, GrLivArea, and YearBuilt
- **Right-skewed distributions**: Most features (LotArea, SalePrice, etc.) are not normally distributedâ€”long tail to the right
- **Neighborhood effects**: Certain neighborhoods (from countplots) consistently command higher prices
- **Quality matters**: Both OverallQual and OverallCond show clear relationship with price
- **Newer is better**: More recent YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd correlate with higher prices

## 4. Preliminary Issues for Modeling

**Missing Values:**
- Many columns have NaN values (visible in first data preview)
- Features like Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature have high missing rates
- Need imputation strategy before training

**Categorical Variables:**
- 43 categorical features (MSZoning, Neighborhood, ExterQual, etc.)
- Must be encoded (one-hot or label encoding) for regression models
- Some have many categories (Neighborhood has 25+)

**Scale Differences:**
- LotArea ranges from ~1,500 to 200,000+
- OverallQual ranges from 1 to 10  
- SalePrice ranges from ~34,000 to 755,000
- Features need normalization/standardization for gradient descent

**Distribution Issues:**
- Many features are highly skewed (not bell-shaped)
- May need log transformation for better model performance
- Outliers could distort model training

---

**Conclusion:** The data shows clear predictive patterns but requires substantial preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categoricals, scaling features, and potentially removing outliers) before model training.
